    - The SPIRE OIDC Discovery Provider is a small helper that provides a minimal implementation of a subset of the OIDC discovery document as related to exposing a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) for JSON Web Token (JWT) validation.

- [spire-controller-manages](https://github.com/spiffe/spire-controller-manager)
    - SPIRE Kubernetes Controller manager which facilitates the registration of workloads and establishment of federation relationships.

- [k8s-workload-registrar](https://github.com/spiffe/spire/tree/main/support/k8s/k8s-workload-registrar)

- [spiffe-aws-assume-role](https://github.com/square/spiffe-aws-assume-role)
    - This tool allows using a SPIFFE JWT to authenticate to AWS APIs

- [Tornjak](https://github.com/spiffe/tornjak)
    - The project aims to provide a management plane and capabilities for SPIFFE identities managed by SPIRE. The goals are to provide global visibility, auditability, and configuration and policy management for identities.

- [SPIFFE Helper](https://github.com/spiffe/spiffe-helper)
    - The SPIFFE Helper is a simple utility for fetching X.509 SVID certificates from the SPIFFE Workload API, launch a process that makes use of the certificates and continuously get new certificates before they expire. The launched process is signaled to reload the certificates when is needed.

- [cert-manager csi-driver-spiffe](https://github.com/cert-manager/csi-driver-spiffe)
    - csi-driver-spiffe is a Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver plugin for Kubernetes to work along cert-manager. This CSI driver transparently delivers SPIFFE SVIDs in the form of X.509 certificate key pairs to mounting Kubernetes Pods.

- [NGINX with SPIFFE support](https://github.com/MarcosDY/spiffe-nginx)

- [Kafka SPIFFE Principal Builder](https://github.com/traiana/kafka-spiffe-principal)
    - A custom KafkaPrincipalBuilder implementation for Apache Kafka. This class and documentation deal only with SslAuthenticationContext, we do not support any other context at the moment (Kerberos, SASL, Oauth)

- [Emissary](https://github.com/github/emissary)
    - This is a service that communicates with spire-agent to fetch and validate JWT-SVIDs sent to it over HTTP, usually from envoy using ext_authz.

- [SPIFFE Vault](https://github.com/philips-labs/spiffe-vault)
    - Integrates SPIFFE SVID authentication with Hashicorp Vault to retrieve a `VAULT_TOKEN`. Example usecases
        - Read secrets from Hashicorp Vault Hashicorp Vault without providing a secret to authenticate against Hashicorp Vault. Instead we will be using a SPIFFE SVID to authenticate ourself against Hashicorp Vault.
        - Perform secretless/keyless code signing by utilizing the Hashicorp Vault Transit engine as a software defined HSM. This resolves the issue of having signing keys on a local machine as well resolves the issue of managing secrets to access the signing keys. Again we utilize the SPIFFE SVID to authenticate against Hashicorp Vault.

- [Kerberos-Attestor](https://github.com/nks5295/kerberos-attestor)
    - The Kerberos-Attestor is a plugin for the SPIRE server and agent that allows SPIRE to automatically attest nodes that are joined to a domain backed by the Kerberos authentication protocol.
